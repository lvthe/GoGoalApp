Terms, or if you do not comply with these Terms, these Terms may be stopped or terminated
without notice from Meta88.
</li>
<li>
<strong>11.2</strong> The termination of these Terms will not preclude Meta88 from seeking

Services is terminated, suspended, or modified.
</li>
<li>
<strong>11.3</strong> The termination of these Terms will not prevent Meta88 from seeking
remedies from you in the case where you have breached any terms or provisions of these terms

</li>
</ul>
<h3>
12. Applicable Law and Dispute Settlement
</h3>
<p>
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO BRING LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>12.1</strong> Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period
<p>
Please first contact Meta88. When possible, Meta88 will try to resolve your problems
without resorting to formal legal action. If you have a dispute with Meta88, you should
contact us and we will provide you with a case number. Meta88 will make every effort to
address your dispute internally as quickly as possible. The parties will agree to engage
in good faith to resolve the dispute, and all discussions will be kept confidential and
protected from being used as evidence in any judicial case under applicable laws.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>12.2</strong> Agreement to Arbitrate
<p>
You and Meta88 agree that subject to Section 12.1 above, any dispute, claim, or
controversy between you and Meta88 that arises in connection with, or relating in any
way, to these Terms, or to your relationship with Meta88 as a user of the Services
(whether by contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms)
will be determined by a mandatory final and binding individual arbitration rather than a
class action, except as set forth below under Exceptions to the Agreement to Arbitrate.
You and Meta88 further agree that the arbitrator will have the exclusive power to rule
on his or her jurisdiction, including, without limitation, any objections with respect
to the existence, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the
arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit
in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION
AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must
follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including,
if applicable, attorney fees, except the arbitrator may not award declaratory or
injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration
provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>12.3</strong> Arbitration Rules
<p>
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms including any question
regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally
 resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
("SIAC") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force. The seat of the

<strong>12.4</strong> Applicable Law
<p>The Applicable Law will be that of Panama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>12.5</strong> Class Action Waiver
<p>
You and Meta88 agree to bring any claims related to these Terms or your relationship
with Meta88 in arbitration on an individual basis exclusively, rather than as a
plaintiff or class member in a putative class or representative action. To the extent
permitted by applicable laws, you and Meta88 also agree to waive any right to have such
claims brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private
attorney general action. Individual arbitrations cannot be combined or consolidated into
a single arbitration without the permission of all parties concerned.
</p>
<p>
Meta88 maintains the right, pursuant to applicable laws, to update, alter, revise,
suspend, or replace Section 12.2 regarding the parties' Agreement to Arbitrate. You
acknowledge and agree that it is your obligation to keep your knowledge of this Section
updated. Continued use of your Account shall be construed as acceptance of any changes
to Section 12 regarding the parties' Agreement to Arbitrate, subject to applicable laws.
If you disagree with the changes to Section 12, you accept that Meta88 may suspend
access to your account pending closure of your account. In such cases, these Terms will
continue in full force and effect, even if they have been modified, and will have an
impact on the upcoming closure of your accessibility.
